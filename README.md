# EC_final_project
This is a repo for my Evolutionary Computation final project

ec_basic.py - Basic algorithm, two-point and uniform crossover are optional, as well as adaptive mutation rate is optional. Max age is also an argument, by default it is 30.

ec_fitness_prop.py - Same as basic algorithm but with either ranked or fitness proportional selection.

ec_tournament.py - Same as basic algorithm but with tournament selection.

ec_largemut.py - Same as basic algorithm but with occasional large mutations.

ec_islands.py - Same as basic algorithm but with 3 islands.

ec_control.py - Same as basic algorithm but with no GRN, output is directly evolved.

main.py - Old version of the code, much much slower than new implementation.
